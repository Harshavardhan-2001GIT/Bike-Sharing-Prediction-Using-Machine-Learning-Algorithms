The Bike Sharing Prediction project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict bike rental demand based on historical data. This project involves a comprehensive approach to data analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The objective is to accurately forecast bike usage patterns, considering factors like weather conditions, holidays, and time of day. The project also includes model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE to ensure the reliability of predictions. This GitHub repository showcases the practical application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem, demonstrating proficiency in data science and predictive modeling.
